Download the CLIP models for satellite images and streetview images and put them in this folder. These files contain checkpointed visual encoder models and the embeddings of images they were used to produce. The model directories also contain the prediction results. Although, our work does not use the streetview model, it needs to be downloaded anyway for the code to run without errors.
